# Alegacy VS Quest Objectives

> **Documentation Version:** v3.0.0

---

## What are Objectives?

**Objectives** are conditions that the player must complete to finish a quest. They track player progress and determine when a quest can be turned in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Objectives** are different from **Actions**:
> - **Objectives** = Conditions the player must *complete* (kill X enemies, walk Y distance)
> - **Actions** = Things that *happen* (give item, play sound, spawn entity)

---

## When Objectives Are Checked

Objectives are defined in the `actionObjectives` array within a quest JSON. They are continuously checked while the quest is active.

```json
{
  "actionObjectives": [
    {
      "id": "objectiveId",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Objective Format

```json
{
  "id": "objectiveId",
  "args": ["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]
}
```

- `id` — The objective identifier (see list below)
- `args` — Array of string arguments passed to the objective

---

## All Available Objectives

Objectives are registered in `QuestObjectiveRegistry`.

### `walkdistance`

Requires the player to walk a certain distance in meters.

**Arguments:**
- `<questId>` — Quest ID for tracking (required)
- `<meters>` — Distance in meters to walk (required)
- `[slot]` — Objective slot for multiple walk objectives (optional)

> [!NOTE]
> Use `resetwalkdistance` action in `onAcceptedActions` to reset distance tracking when quest starts.

---

### `randomkill`

Completes when all random-kill slots rolled for the quest are finished.

This objective relies on the `randomkill` action to set up targets and store progress.

**Arguments:**
- `<questId>` — Quest ID for tracking (required)
- `<slot>` — Which random kill slot to check (required)

The `randomkill` action in `onAcceptedActions` generates the kill targets. Each slot corresponds to a randomly selected mob to hunt.

---

## Objective Helper Actions

These are quest **actions** that support objectives. They are often placed in `onAcceptedActions` or invoked by scripts/events.
